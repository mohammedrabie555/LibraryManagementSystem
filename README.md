# LibraryManagementSystem
A Java console application for managing books, members, and borrowing operations in a library using OOP techniques.

# Library Management System ðŸ“š

A console-based Java application that allows a librarian to manage books, members, and lending operations.
Created to strengthen understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

## Features

2. Display all available books
3. Display specific book information
4. Update or modify specific book information

11. Return a borrowed book from a specific member
12. Remove member
13. Search for a member

## Concepts Used

* Encapsulation: Hiding details of Book and Member classes.
* Inheritance: Different user roles (e.g., Librarian, Member) derived from a base Person class.
* Composition: Library class contains lists of Book and Member objects.
* Polymorphism: Methods like displayInfo() behave differently based on the class type.

## Technologies

* Java SE (Console-based)
* Simple text-based interface

## How to Run

Compile the project:
* javac Main.java
* Run the program:
* java Main

## Purpose

Developed to demonstrate how OOP can be used to design an organized system for managing books and members, similar to real-world library workflows.
